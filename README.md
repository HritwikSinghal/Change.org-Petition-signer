# Sign change.org petitions automatically
![#c5f015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) 
Edit (June 2020) : So apparently Change.org added a Bot prevention script and
made this project useless. But Now i have implemented workaround and this is working fine. Also, proxy support has been removed.

For Windows & Linux Only. Not Compatible with MacOS.

Uses Selenium.It will automatically ask for url and whether to use
proxies or not. If you chose to sign using proxies, it will auto fetch proxies and sign
using them.
